Hi, we are Jiyun, Tessel, Giorgio and Alyssa, and this is the TM Group 3's github repository.
We are working on negation cue detection.

Here, you will find:
- the annotations on negation cues
- the code to perform feature extraction on our datasets
- the code to run two classifiers
- the code to perform an ablation study with those two classifiers
